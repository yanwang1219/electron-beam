simulate electron beam systems
## Introduction
A simple simulator for electron beam
### Environment
This electron beam system consists of a x_selector made of two capacitors on the left and right side respectively. One capacitor consists of one pair plate. Regarding one plate, it is consisted of many electrons, which can generate emitted electrical field to the space. Then the superimposed electrical field generated from two pair plates are applied in the space.

### Initial state
The rejected particle owns only an initial velocity along the z-axis. And it will release from the 0 point along the z_axis, but any point along the x-axis.
### Result
The particle will shift the trajectory due to the electrical field in the space.
### Outlook
The system would be created, which includes one x_selector and one y_selector through 3-demission.
